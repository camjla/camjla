 ##About ME
  
📚 I like study, my English and Spanish is basic/ technic because I study alone in courses with Kultivi and youtube videos.
I have desire to study Korean, because I like so much the culture, musics, k-dramas and my korean friends. I hope someday visit this country.

🌻 I want to be able to positively impact people with my work.

😁 Fun Facts: I like to dance, watch series, preferably k-dramas, read novels that take me out of reality and always be getting to know new hobbies and places.
